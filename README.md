# HackNiche : Online Verification of Certificates using Blockchain

Features :
+ Users can apply for an e-certificate to the particular
institution/organization.
+ The institution/organization should verify the
application by accepting/rejecting the application.
+ The approved certificate's serial number should be
recorded and stored on the blockchain.
+ Upon approval of the certificate, the user should
receive a serial number and QR code.
+ So, if the user submits the serial number/QR code to
any organization, the organization can then verify
whether the certificate is valid or not.
+ If a user submits a certificate containing serial number
or QR code, the organization can report that particular
user
